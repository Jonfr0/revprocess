            <p className="font-inter text-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              RevProcess (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) operates as a Dedicated Backend Partner for select creators and coaches. This is not a course, mastermind, or &quot;done-for-you&quot; agency. Instead, we act as a true partner, taking ownership of backend systems and operations so you can focus on your content and expertise.
            </p>
            <p className="font-inter text-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Because this is a partnership-based model, there is no standard retail price or program fee. Engagements are individualized, often based on revenue-share or performance-based agreements.
            </p>

              We make no claims, representations, or guarantees that you will achieve specific results, revenue, or outcomes by entering into a partnership with RevProcess.

              While examples of potential results and benefits may be shared for educational or illustrative purposes, these are not promises of what you will achieve. Your results will vary depending on factors including (but not limited to): your background, experience, work ethic, niche, offer quality, and market conditions.
